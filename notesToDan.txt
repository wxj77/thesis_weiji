% this note describes what I have renewed and added from previous version. It also records what I want to do next.

1.  intro chapter
	fix sereval typos you point out.
	fix bib files
	fix figure citations
	fix number and units so that they look much better.
	add transaction paragraph to nucleosynthesis.
	todo :
		add paragraph to 3.5keV
		add paragraph to weak lensing
		add paragraph to weak lensing of CMB, or delete where this is mentioned in the first paragraph.
		add chapter candidates 
		add section freeze in freeze out

2. gas test description
	todo:
	   quiet time cut: address uniformity of electric field in anode cone region, address "s2" pulse shape
	   change all succeed to follow
	    on the illustration figures: change top bottom grid to anodic cathodic grid, change top bottom pmt to pmt .
		add description of each time ramp voltage and kill voltage to zero before next test, to operation section
		add section calibration
		add section cuts
		in section cuts:
			add subsection dataset selection
			add subsection simulation
			add each cut description
		add section cut efficiency evaluation

I finished upto before calibration section. 
​
It was nice to have the hand copy correction if it is easier for you. It would help me if you can also point out my grammar mistakes at the same time. However I have trouble reading your hand writing earlier because the characters in a word are connected to each other. Because I am not familiar with the word you are using, if I cannot guess its meaning from the earlier and latter context, I completely lose the meaning of the sentence. 
If revising my thesis on hard copy is easier for you, I can use that too, and want better character separation.

2. gas test description
add section general description
vessel, gas system, circulation, 
test mass, high voltage feed through, 
add section DAQ
add section run selection
add section data processing
add subsection coincidence finding explain it
todo:
add section calibration
add section cuts
in section cuts:
add subsection dataset selection
add subsection simulation
add each cut description
add section cut efficiency evaluation
​
3. move RQ list for gas test to appendix.
​
4. add abbreviation appendix.
