* why not neon?
* why muon event s1 is longer?
* Radon activity estimation
* choice of Coincidenc Window Width (CWW)
* sphe area, I now do not know the correct way to do it.
* Cherenkov amplitude in PTFE
* muon light charge yield compared to alpha beta gamma (100eV, 22eV)
	*  yield for every particle
* light guide/CSDA reference (from your package)
	* PTFE reflectivity
	* SS reflectivity
	* PTFE stopping power?
