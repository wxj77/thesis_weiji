We apply one field in the liquid volume to drift ionization electrons upwards and another in the gas volume to extract these electrons from the liquid in order to produce proportional scintillation light (S2). Achieving high voltages on such grids is necessary for the operation of the LZ TPC. However, such high voltages also increase the rate of electron emission ,which is one of the potential sources of background in LZ.

An Alicat MC-5SLPM-D-485 mass flow controller (MFC) on the gas circulation panel controls the circulation flow rate, which allows a maximum flow rate of \SI{5}{\slpm}, as described in Ref.~\cite{AlicatScientific}. During the gas purification process, the flow of gas was controlled and driven through the getter for \SI{\sim 20}{\min} to allow the complete absorption of the gas impurities in the detector. This process is frequently conducted between each dataset to ensure the gas purity quality.

> The addition and removal of xenon gas are carried out with the same gas panel. Two \SI{4}{\liter} bottles (Fig.~\ref{fig:chambergeneral:bottles}) are used for the storage of xenon gas used in the tests when the gas is not used in the detector. During the xenon gas removal process, these bottles are inserted into two dewars filled with liquid nitrogen. Reducing the temperature of the bottles by using liquid nitrogen allows xenon gas to flow through the gas circulation panel back to the bottles, and to condense inside the bottles. During the addition of xenon gas process, the bottles are taken out from the dewar and warmed up. This process raises the gas pressure in the bottle, which drives the gas to fill the detector through the getter on the gas panel. The gas flow is controlled by the gas regulator and the MFC on the panel.

< The trigger system for DAQ makes decisions for data recording. Customized parameters in the DAQ trigger system are set in a XML file. These parameters are called XML parameters. The pulse trigger and recording is done in a pending mode which is  different from normal DAQ system. The continuous digitized pulse amplitude data are compared to the pre threshold value until finding a threshold crossing. This is the trigger time. Pulse recording will also including a preceding segment of samples, which is called pre delay. Digitized data are then compared to the post threshold value until finding a threshold crossing. Pulse recording will also including a following segment of samples, which is called post delay. During the post delay era, the digitized data are compared to the pre threshold again. If no threshold crossing is found, the pulse recording will end when the post delay era end. Otherwise, the DAQ will keep recording until after a post threshold crossing, no other pre threshold crossing can be found in the next post delay era. The pre threshold values are chosen so that the \sphe\ trigger efficiencies of both PMTs are larger than \SI{95}{\percent}. The trigger efficiencies are estimated by fitting \sphe\ amplitude distributions to Gaussian distribution curves. Results of these evaluations show that at normal PMT operation voltage(\SI{1.5}{\kV}) the top PMT and the bottom PMT have good trigger efficiencies of \SI{99.6}{\percent} and \SI{>99.9}{\percent}.

> \paragraph{Recording} %f1 
> The recording system for DAQ makes decisions for data recording. The decision making algorithm is controlled by customized DAQ XML parameters in an XML file. The pulse recording is undertaken in a pending mode without a conventional trigger, which is explained below. First, the continuous digitized pulse amplitude data are compared to a pre-threshold voltage (trigger voltage), which is called the pre-threshold value, until a threshold crossing is reached. The time of this threshold crossing is the pulse recording reference time. Pulse recording also includes a preceding segment of samples, which is called the pre-delay. The start time of the pre-delay period is the pulse recording start time. Next, digitized data are compared to a post-threshold voltage, which is called the post-threshold value, until a threshold crossing is reached. Then, the pulse recording continues for a succeeding segment of samples, which is called the post-delay. During the post-delay period, the digitized data are compared to the pre-threshold value again. If no pre-threshold crossing is reached, the pulse recording ends when the post-delay period ends. Otherwise, the DAQ system keeps recording until after a post-threshold crossing is reached, no other pre-threshold crossing is reached in the next post-delay period. The end time of the last post-delay period is the pulse recording stop time. The pre-threshold values are chosen so that the \sphe\ recording efficiency, also called the trigger efficiency, of both PMTs are larger than \SI{95}{\percent}. The trigger efficiency is estimated by fitting \sphe\ amplitude distributions to Gaussian distributions, as described in Section~\ref{sec:pmt cal}. Results of these evaluations show that at normal PMT operating voltage (\SI{-1.5}{\kV}) the top PMT and the bottom PMT have good trigger efficiency of \SI{99.6}{\percent} and \SI{>99.9}{\percent}. The recorded pulses are called pulses of digitization (PODs), which are one of the fundamental elements for the next step; coincidence event building, as described in Section~\ref{sec:gtest data process}.

< The reason for dead time is because buffer writing and data transfer in the DAQ system cannot happen at the same time. 
---
> We studied the dead time issue by using two methods. The first method is finding problematic pulses that might be a result of dead time. We found there exist a population of pulses that when one PMT detects large quantities of photons, the other PMT detects no photon simultaneously. Since the two PMTs are observing the same space in the ELD, we expect to see similar magnitude of photons in both PMTs. The most likely reason for this to happen is that the other PMT channel is suffering from dead time. The other possible causes of these problematic pulses, such as misbehavior of one PMT, are less dominant. The time difference between the recording time of large quantities of photons in one PMT and the first preceding pulse in the dead time problematic PMT is the potential duration of dead time, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pulse dead time}. 
> More than \num{400} dead time problematic pulses are examined. From the examinations, we found that for a particular pulse with a duration of \SI{2}{\us}, the duration of dead time is in the range of \SIrange{0.3}{15}{\us}. For longer pulses, we observe the duration of dead time for as long as \SI{80}{\us}.

< Dead time is studied with finding the pulse that have large quantities of photons in one PMT and no record in the other PMT at the same time. These are potential dead time issue pulses. Causes of these issue pulses can also be misbehavior of one PMT or a large quantity of photon production inside one PMT. The time difference between the potential issue pulse in one PMT and the first preceding pulse in the other PMT is the potential duration of dead time.

> %The second method is finding the probability difference of the pulse recording stop time and the pulse recording start time of two sequentially recorded pulses between pulses recorded by one PMT and pulsed assuming uniform time distribution, which should mimic the case with no dead time issue. 
> To estimate the systematic error, we employ a second method based on the idea that the presence of dead time will shift the distribution of time intervals between pulses in one PMT. In the absence of dead time, the time distribution should be an exponential characterized by the average rate. The impact of dead time is to shift time difference probability an exponential curve, which is from assuming uniform distribution:
> \begin{align}

< Thus, a fraction of events that have quiet preceding are used to study the absolute rate of signals of interest. These resolves the dead time issue. DAQ trigger of the selected quiet preceding pulses are equivalent to DAQ trigger without the dead time issue. Details of how quiet preceding selection is done are discussed below in Section.~\ref{sec:uncor}.

> Results of this shift is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:PMTdeadtime}. %The figure shows the best fit exponential curve of two sequentially recorded pulses time differences in one PMT that have such time difference larger than \SI{100}{\us}. 
> %This fitted curve better reflects the distribution of no dead time issue case by subtracting the potential duration of dead time. 
> %The difference between the fit curve and the data reflects the influence of the duration of dead time, which indicates the dead time issue is subdominant after \SI{20}{\us}.  
> The figure includes studies of pulses categorized by their durations. These studies confirm the previous conclusion on the dead time issue dominant period, and further show that such period has a dependence on the preceding pulse duration. The clear low statistics at the small time interval range, e.g. range \SIrange{0}{e5}{\ns} for pulse length in the range of larger than \SI{30}{\us}, clearly showed the shift from expected exponential curve. The low statistic region changes with preceding pulse duration, as summarized in Table~\ref{tab:PMT dead time duration}. The difference on the slopes of these curves is due to PTFE fluorescence subsequent to each pulse, which is more obvious for larger area (long duration) pulses, and increases the succeeding average rate, as will be discussed in Section~\ref{sec:events}.

< This section discusses pulse selections, aka cuts, that are used in \gtest\ analysis. The purpose of this analysis is searching for \eep s from tested grid wires and correctly estimating the rate of this process. Pulse selections are done on different parameter spaces. For each pulse selection, possibility of removing signals of interest (in this case: \eep ) is evaluated. The primary principle of pulse selections is to get a clean population distribution of \eep\ to get a reliable estimation of its rate. Other than that, since \eep\ s are in most situation rare in the detector, pulse selections of these \eep s are done conservatively. That is to keep as many candidates for \eep s as possible.

> Among all different classes of events, our primary pulse of interest is \eee , which happens in the EL region. We estimate the light collection in this region with the same method mentioned before and finer binning. We start with \num{500000} simulations of single photons every \SI{2}{\mm} in r dimension in the middle of the EL region.  Results of the simulations are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig: light collection r 040}. Light collection efficiency in the EL region falls away at r  \SI{> 65}{\mm}, which is the inner radius of the PTFE reflector cones. %The TBA also changes at r > \SI{65}{\mm}.

The average total PMT light collection efficiency in the EL region is \num{\sim 0.017}. For most \eee\ that photon production is larger than \num{300}, an average number of \num{\sim 5} photoelectrons would be observed. Therefore, this light collection efficiency is sufficient to allows us to detect \eee s.
434c605,606
< \subparagraph{Electron emission} A cartoon for the physical process and an example waveform of \eep\ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:eep}. An electron leaves the cathodic electrode from various types of emission processes. After the electron left the wire surface, the high electric field around the cathodic wire will quickly energize the electrons. The high energy electron ionizes and excites the atoms around it and create more electrons. In this region, more EL light is produced per second comparing to a lower electric field region. This is the cause of the "peak" at the beginning of the \eep . This process is called electron multiplication. Then, these electrons drift to the anodic electrode due to the operation voltage difference between the two grids. EL light is produced along this drift. This correspond to the majority of EL light seen in the \eep . There is a clear start and stop time for the \eep . Duration of the \eep\ is roughly the duration of this drift. After this, electrons get close to the anodic electrode. Since the electric field around the anodic wires are also high, electrons also go through a similar electron multiplication process. This process also creates more electrons and a higher density of EL light. This is the cause of the "peak" at the ending of \eep . The peak at the end of the pulse is lower than the peak at the beginning of the pulse. This is because of dispersion of the arrival times of electrons on anodic electrode. This dispersion is due to the different microscopic trajectory each electron takes to reach the anodic electrode. Different arrival times of the electrons cause the final increment of EL light productions from different electrons do not happen coincidently. This lowers the height of the peak at the ending of the \eep . Another reason for the different height of the peak is due to the electric field on the anodic wire is smaller than cathodic wire. It also results in a smaller production of EL light.

< Therefore, one important signature of \eep\ is the EL duration. EL duration is approximately equal to duration of electron drift between the two electrodes. The deviation of electric field between the two electrode is much smaller than the average value of it. So the drift duration can be roughly estimated by, 
< 
< \begin{align}
< 	\text{drift duration} = \frac{\text{distance between two electrodes}}{\text{drift velocity at the average electric field between two electrodes} }

< 
< EL light production in the majority part of \eep\ is uniform, except for the beginning and the ending of the pulse. Since the electron multiplication around the cathodic wires happens early in the process before the major era of EL light production. The total counts of photons created in an \eep\  can be estimated as,
< \begin{align}
< 	\# \text{photons created} & \approx \# \text{electrons after (cathodic) electron multiplication} \\
< 	& \times \# \text{EL photons production per single electron}
< \end{align}
< 
< The counts of electrons after (cathodic) electron multiplication are related to the surface electric field on the cathodic wire. The value of the cathodic surface electric field can be estimated from the operation voltage, wire diameter and wire pitch of the two grid. The counts of EL light production per single electron are related to the distance and the electric field between the two grids. The average photon yield per EL distance is a known function of electric field. The value of the electric field between two grid can also be estimated from the operation voltage, wire diameter and wire pitch of the two grids.

< \paragraph{Electron multiplication simulation}Electron multiplication is studied using gas simulation softwares. A simple geometry is build and meshed in GMSH, as described in Ref.~{Gmsh2011}. Fig.~\ref{fig:gmshsimple} shows the built geometry. This geometry includes a thin cylinder surface in the center representing the grid wire as the electron emission surface, and a thick cylinder surface outside representing the cut off distance of electron multiplication. The cut off distance is chosen to be sufficiently long so that the electric field beyond this distance is too small to allow significant electron multiplication. The diameter of the two cylinders are \SI{75}{\um} and \SI{1}{cm}. Voltages are assigned to two cylinders to create a chosen electric field on the surface of the wire. Then, the electric field map in this full geometry is solved by ElmerGrid, as described in Ref.~{Elmergrid2000}.  The gas simulation is done with Magboltz in Garfield interface, as described in Ref.~\ref{Magboltz, Garfield}. These softwares implement light yield and charge yield, aka the photon and electron productions, for electrons moving in gas medium as a function of reduced electron field. By including the electric field map, choosing the correct gas density, these softwares simulate the photon and electron productions with an electron that initiate from the wire surface. 
< 
< An example of electron multiplication simulation in the simple geometry is shown in Fig:~\ref{fig:electron multiplication sim}. As the electron moves further away from the wire surface, both light production and electron production reduce. Results of the counts of electron multiplication vs surface electric field at different gas density is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:electron multiplication}. 
< 
< 
< 
< 
< Light collection of created photons also influence the total counts and duration of \eep . The approximately \SI{2}{\percent} light collection efficiency in the ELD results in only a portion of EL photons are seen by the PMTs. It causes the waveform of an \eep\ more coarsely distributed in time. This low number of collected photons also increases the difficulty of estimating the real EL duration.

< Both PMTs have pulses that occur with a time difference smaller than CWW. 
< 
< \paragraph{Purpose}
< This is to make sure that the signal of interest is unlikely to be from dark current in one PMT, afterpulsing in one PMT, dead time or misbehavior period of one PMT, or other \sphe\ source (ex. fluorescence light from PTFE, microscopic sparking) in one PMT. This is also to make sure the signal of interest is not from a random coincidence of previous sources in one PMT channel. 
< 
< Coincidence found and coincidence pulse building are the fundamental part of this analysis. Cuts defined later are based on the classification of coincidence pulses. 
< 
< \paragraph{Method}
< Details are discussed in data processing section in the earlier context, see Section.~\ref{par:coinbuild}. 
< 
< %The efficiency of this cut is \opdv\ dependent. For a proper choice of \opdv , the efficiency of this cut is larger than \SI{90}{\percent}. 
< 
< \subsection{Uncorrelated from preceding pulses}
< \label{sec:uncor}
< This cut is to make sure that the signal of interest is not in the tail of any preceding signal.
< Source of this type of background are: (1) an anode cone event, and (2) fluorescence photon following a big pulse. The cuts for resolving these two backgrounds are (1) short following period veto, and (2) long following period veto.
<  
< \subsubsection{Short following period veto}
< 
< \paragraph{Definition}
< Coincidence pulse is not following another pulse within \SI{100}{\us}
< \paragraph{Purpose}
< This is to make sure the signal of interest is not a part of anode cone event. This is also to resolve dead time of DAQ. 
< 
< \subparagraph{Anode cone event} A cartoon for the physical process and an example waveform of anode cone event are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:AboveAnode}. An external particle can enter the anode cone region and deposit energy there. This process excites xenon atoms in the cone region and results in generating scintillation photons and free electrons. The scintillation photons are collected and seen immediately. These free electrons drift to the anodic grid. Electric field in the cone region is too small to produce large quantity of EL light during electron drift. However, when these electrons get close to the anodic grid wire, the electric field around the anodic grid wires are big enough to produce EL light. This is the source of the secondary photon signal, which follows the preceding signal after the amount of time that it took electron to drift. The time separation is estimated by the known measured electron drift velocity in gaseous xenon, as described in Ref.~\ref{enlishhanna, Brooks}. Electron drift velocity in gaseous xenon is approximately \SI{5.56}{\mm\per\us\per\townsend} for reduced electric field in range \SIrange{5}{25}{\townsend}. The maximum separation time for this detector at xenon gas density \standarddensity , \opvt\ in range \SIrange{+4}{+8}{\kV} is approximately \SIrange{85}{75}{\us}. The value of this maximum separation time decreases as decreasing the operation pressure in the detector. The value of maximum separation time drives the choice of \SI{100}{\us} quiet preceding requirement. 
< 
< This background from the secondary photon signals in anode cone events has a different pulse shape from \eep . The pulse shape of the secondary photon signals has a comparably slower rising and falling edge at the beginning and the ending of it. It also has a higher TBA. This is because EL around the anode wire primarily happens above the anodic wire. The bottom PMT is in the shadow of grid wires when the top PMT is not. It causes a ratio of \num{\sim 2} increment on light collection ratio between top PMT and bottom PMT. These characteristic signatures are useful for veto large area anode cone events. However, when their pulse area get smaller (probably due to a lower energy deposition of external particles), it becomes difficult to find these pulses by their shape. Thus, this cut is performed.  
< 
< This cut also removes \todo{describe the small area stuff.}
< 
< This cut also resolves the dead time issue, \todo{explain here.}
< 
< \paragraph{Method}
< For the start time of each coincidence pulse, a searching is done for pulses in the preceding \SI{100}{\us}. If there is any pulse in any PMT, the coincidence pulse is vetoed. 
< 
< The effect of this cut is shown in Fig.\ref{}.

< \subsubsection{Long following period}
< 
< \paragraph{Definition}
< Coincidence pulse is not following any single pulse that has pulse area larger than \SI{100}{\phe} within \SI{10}{\ms}
< \paragraph{Purpose}
< This is to make sure the signal of interest is not following a large EL light production. An example waveform is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:PTFEFluo}. Following a EL light production, PTFE will absorb the EL photons and re-emit photons not immediately. The time distribution of the after emission of photons roughly follow an exponential decay model. This effect is called PTFE luminescence This effect is noticed in the precious literatures. Measurements of fluorescence rates and decay time $\tau$ have a various range. This might be caused by different conditions of synthesis, as described in Ref.~\cite{Gachkovskii1969}. This effect is also believed to cause the slow decay of electron signal in liquid xenon TPCs. A decay time of \SI{2.3}{\ms} is reported in Ref.\cite{Sorensen2018}. A decay time of \SI{10}{\ms} is reported in internal review in \luxe . The accidental coincidence of the following emission from PTFE can mimic an \eep . The rate of PTFE fluorescence is strongly dependent on the previous luminance history in the detector. Thus, this cut is performed after all large EL production in the detector.

< \subsubsection{Further discussion on following period veto cuts}
< These two cuts previously mentioned have potential to veto good candidate \eep s . Thus, survival ratio of the candidate \eep s need to be estimated. The survival ratio is estimated by how much is the fraction of a careful selection of coincidence pulses survive these cuts.
< The careful selection of coincidence pulses also need to be uncorrelated from preceding pulses. The careful selection is the coincidence pulses in \ttwoseven\ range \SIrange{0}{200}{\ns},  pulse area range \SIrange{25}{250}{\phe}. This selection is a conservative selection of \sone\ pulses that has few contaminations from other sources. Since \sone\ is from the primary light production of external particle sources, this selection of pulses are uncorrelated from preceding pulses. Thus, it can be used for estimating the survival ratio. The survival ratio is called quiet fraction(QF). For normal operation, QF is in range \numrange{0.6}{0.9}. Details of this physical sources of S1 pulses will be discussed in the following Section.~\ref{cuts:S1}: \sone\ conservative population.

< Coincidence pulse has a positive pulse area in all PMT channels, and a higher than \num{0.5} positive negative amplitude ratio. This coincidence also mush have a non-zero \ttenninety.
565,573d720
< \paragraph{Purpose}
< This is to make sure the signal of interest is not an electrical noise pulse. 
< An example waveform of electrical noise pulse is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:noise}. 
< These electrical noises come from the grounding of the infrastructures and detector electronic devices. 
< An electrical noise pulse has a comparable pulse negative maximum amplitude and pulse positive amplitude. Its pulse area is usually smaller and sometimes negative.  
< An electrical noise pulse also tend to have the waveforms in two PMTs overlapping. 
< The negative integrated pulse area usually also makes it impossible to find the pulse characteristic time differences. 
< Thus, this cut is performed. This cut ensures all characteristic time differences to be computable. 
< During the tests, electrical noise pulses occurs at a rate of approximately \SI{2}{\Hz}.

< \subsubsection{Multiple \sphe }
577,578d722
< \paragraph{Definition}
< In the coincidence pulse, one of the two PMTs contains pulse that has more than one \sphe .
580,587d723
< \paragraph{Purpose}
< This is to make sure the signal of interest is not a random coincidence of dark current (or other \sphe\ source) between two PMTs. 
< This random coincidence is also called false coincidence pulse. 
< The PMTs that are used in this study have a \SI{\sim 1}{\kHz} dark current rate. 
< CWW is \SI{1.7}{\us} in this analysis. 
< Combination of these two values lead to a \SI{\sim 3.4}{\Hz} rate of false coincidence pulse. 
< The \sphe\ source is not limited to dark current. 
< For example, PTFE fluorescence that is discussed previously, and microscopic discharge could also be a \sphe\ source. 
589,596d724
< \subparagraph{Microscopic discharge}\label{sec:microdischarge} Microscopic discharges happen outside the ELD could be a potential source of \sphe\ background.  
< In sparking tests, we observe discharges on the high voltage feed throughs and cables. 
< These discharges are caused by the smoothness of the high voltage surfaces (especially metallic surfaces) are imperfect. 
< This imperfectness microscopically creates a high field region, and initialized a high ionization probability of the medium (especially gas medium) surrounding it and causes a discharge. The quantity of light production of this discharge are big. 
< The quantity also has a various range. 
< However, since these discharge activities happens outside the ELD, light collection for these activities are usually poor. 
< So these activities may end up having one or several \sphe s in each PMTs. 
< Thus, microscopic discharge is also a potential \sphe\ source. 
598d725
< Therefore, to reduce the misclassification from false coincidence, this cut is performed. 
600,605d726
< \paragraph{Method}
< This cut is a combination with series of vetoes.
< Pulse area and pulse duration are used for computing these vetoes.
< A coincidence pulse is vetoed if the total pulse area is smaller than \SI{2.5}{\phe} and the pulse area in at least one of the PMTs is smaller than \SI{1.5}{\phe}. 
< This choice is to compensate the \SI{\sim 30}{\percent} systematic fluctuation of PMT \sphe\ area. 
< A coincidence pulse is also vetoed if the pulse duration in both PMTs are "short". The definition of "short" is a single pulse \ttwoseven\ smaller than \SI{80}{\ns}, and  $t_{95}$ smaller than \SI{320}{\ns}. The scatter plot of \ttwoseven\ and $t_{95}$ is shown in Fig.\ref{}.

< The narrow coincidence pulses can be separated to two categories: (1) extremely narrow coincidence pulses, and (2) not extremely narrow coincidence pulse.
---
> \paragraph{Primary scintillation} Primary scintillation is the process in which photons are created directly by energy deposition of external particle events. These photons have two sources: direct excitation, and excitation from recombination after ionization. An external particle travels through the medium in the ELD, transferring its energy to atoms in the medium, e.g. xenon, through exciting and ionizing these atoms. The excited atoms will return to their ground states by emitting photons of series energies corresponding to the energy level of the atoms, which is called relaxation of the excited atom. These photons from direct excitation from external particles are the first source of primary scintillation photons. The ionized atoms are not able to produce photons by themselves. However, they can recombine with the electrons around them and form excited atoms, which deexcite in a similar process as direct excited atoms, and emit photons simultaneously. These photons are the second source of primary scintillation photons. The quantity of second source of primary scintillation photons is dependent on the recombination process, which depends on properties of the atoms, and is influenced by the detector environment, especially the electric field (or reduced electric field) on the recombination site. A strong electric field forces electrons to quickly drift away from the ionization site and reduce the probability of recombination, thus reduce the quantity of primary scintillation light production. 
> %These two primary scintillation processes happen fast in most medium.  
615,616c736
< \paragraph{Purpose}
< This is to make sure the signal of interest is not a potential (1) Cherenkov radiation event, (2) microscopic discharge event, and (3) primary scintillation light (S1) from an external particle. 
---
> \paragraph{Electroluminescence} Electroluminescence (EL) is a phenomenon in which when an electron drifts through a strong electric field in a medium, it collides with atoms in the medium, excites them which will afterwards emit scintillation light. Since, EL process is related to electrons in the medium, we measure EL photons to study the electron production in the detector. The mechanism of EL is similar to primary scintillation; the electron gains energy from drifting through the strong electric field and simultaneously loses energy though exciting and ionizing medium atoms. Moreover, the ionization process are usually associated with electron multiplication (gas gain), which creates more electrons in the strong electric field region, and produces more EL scintillation light. The quantity of EL scintillation photons and the probability of electron multiplication, are related to the strength of reduced electric field of the medium. With proper strength of reduced electric field, EL can produce more photons than primary scintillation. Because of its association with electrons and its production quantity, EL photons are the most important signals measured in the ELD.  
618c738
< \subparagraph{Cherenkov} Cherenkov radiations in PTFE material (and PMT window) are considered one of the potential sources for the extremely narrow pulses. A cartoon for the physical process and an example waveform of extremely narrow pulse are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Chrenkov}. Cherenkov radiation is the photon radiation when a charged particle is traveling through a medium with its speed higher than the speed of light in this medium. The charged particle could be an external charged particle or electrons that originate from energy loss of external particle in the medium. The Cherenkov events originate from energy loss are the potential explanation for the extremely narrow pulses.
---
> The primary scintillation photons are called \sone , and the EL scintillation photons are called \stwo , because the primary scintillation photons are produced earlier than the other photons created by electroluminescence process of uncombined electrons.  The same concepts of primary scintillation, as well as \sone, \stwo ,  are also used in liquid noble detectors, as described in Chapter.~\ref{chap:lz}. 
620c740,741

---
> \paragraph{Noble gas scintillation}
> For most noble gas atoms (\ce{A}), e.g. neon, argon, krypton, and xenon, the scintillation process usually forms an intermediate excited excimer state (\ce{A_2^*}). The emitted photons from the intermediate excimer state are almost monoenergetic, \SI{7.1}{\electronvolt} (\SI{\sim 175}{\nm}), which  the medium is transparent to. Because of the existence of the intermediated excited excimer states, it creates appreciable quantity of monoenergetic photons from the excitation of these states. These features allow us to efficiently collect these monoenergetic photons with specialized devices, e.g. PMTs, and use these photons to study reactions between external particles and medium atoms.

> These two primary scintillation processes happen fast in xenon, the duration of which is dominated by the excimers decay time. The excimers can be separated to two types, the singlet state (\ce{^1\sigma_u^+}, \ce{0_u^+}) and triplet state (\ce{^3\sigma_u^+}, \ce{1_u^+}), with separate decay times. The singlet state and the triplet state are known to be created from a three-body deconstruction of noble gas atom excited state \ce{^2P_{1/2}} state and \ce{^2P_{3/2}} state, which has a different initial quantity from the event. Because these creation processes are three body reactions, the creation rate of the these two states have strong dependence on the gas density of atoms. The decay time of both of these two states have a dependence on the gas density, as described in  Ref.~\cite{Keto1974}. Some other materials also show that the decay time is very different between liquid noble gas and very dense noble gas. The decay time for the singlet state and the triplet state in liquid xenon are \SI[separate-uncertainty=false]{4.3 \pm 0.6}{\ns}  and \SI[separate-uncertainty=false]{22.0 \pm 2.0}{\ns}, as measured in Ref.~\cite{Hitachi1983}. For dense xenon with pressure in the range of \SIrange{2.7}{32}{\atm}, the decay time for singlet states varies from \SI[separate-uncertainty=false]{15 \pm 3}{\ns} to \SI[separate-uncertainty=false]{5.5 \pm 1.0}{\ns}. The decay time for triplet state is \SI[separate-uncertainty=false]{96 \pm 5}{\ns} in the same pressure range.

We take the photon wavelength is in range \SIrange{160}{650}{\nm} (the spectral response range for PMT R11410-10, as described in Ref.~\ref{Hamamatsu}), the PTFE refractive index to be approximately 2 ($\epsilon$ \num{\sim 4}). N is about \num{150}. The attenuation distance of photons is in range \SIrange{1}{4}{\cm} for \SIrange{30}{300}{\keV} electrons for PTFE. 
< The light collection is in range (\SIrange{1.5}{15}{\percent}). 
< The estimated number of photons seen by the PMTs is in range up to \SI{\sim 100}{\phe}. 
< This number is hard to predict precisely because of the complicated geometry of ELD. This is not a very big number but enough to be seen by the PMTs. 
< %However, the possibility of seeing these photons still exist. 
< Thus, Cherenkov is still one of the optimal explanations for the extremely narrow pulses.

< One of the most convincing evidence is this population of events are seen in the detector at vacuum condition. Fig.~\ref{fig:Chrenkov c} shows the \pud\ vs pulse area plot from a dataset with \opvtvb\ at \SI{0}{\kV}, \opgd\ at vacuum. The red population seen are the selected extremely narrow pulses. Extremely narrow pulses in vacuum data consist of events that potentially come Cherenkov in PTFE.  They may come from both external charged particles and energy loss of external particles. An external muon particle will go through the PTFE cones. During the traveling of the muon particle, it ionizes and radiates photon. Since muon particles are usually more energetic than other external particles like gamma radiation, the photon radiation from muon events is usually strong. This is one explanation for the hot spot at (\num{e2},\num{e2}) in Fig.~\ref{fig:Chrenkov c}. When the detector is filled with xenon gas, the muon particle can also ionize xenon gas atoms. This produces scintillation photons and increases muon events duration. It explains the reason that this hot spot disappears in xenon gas data. Details for explanations of muon events in xenon gas data are in Section.~\ref{sec:muon}. The pulses with pulse area in range \SIrange{0}{e2}{\phe} and pulse duration in range \SIrange{0}{2e2}{\ns} in Fig.~\ref{fig:Chrenkov c} are potentially Cherenkov events from external gamma radiation loss energy in PTFE (and PMT window). The gamma radiation ionized PTFE and free electrons which can potentially emit Cherenkov light.
< When the detector is filled with xenon gas, the same physical source of gamma radiation applies. This explains why a similar population of extremely narrow pulses exist in both vacuum data (Fig.~\ref{fig:Chrenkov c}) and xenon gas data  (Fig.~\ref{fig:Chrenkov d}).

> An EL process is usually associated with simultaneous electron multiplication. This process describes an electric accelerated by electric field, collides with gas molecules, ionize them generating additional free electrons. The chemical process is, 
> \begin{align}
> \text{EL process (electron multiplication): }&\ce{e^- + Xe -> e^- + e^-  +Xe^{+}}
> \end{align}
> The probability of electron multiplication per electron per unit length is also quoted as the first Townsend ionization coefficient ($\alpha$), which depends on the strength of reduced electric field, as measured in Ref.~\cite{Kruithof1940, Derenzo1974}. Conventionally, reduced first Townsend ionization coefficient is measured with E/$p_0$ instead of reduced electric field, where E is the electric field; $p_0$ is pressure of the gas reduced to \SI{0}{\celsius}. The reduced first Townsend ionization coefficient $\eta \equiv \alpha / E$ is also frequently used.The measured reduced first Townsend ionization coefficient is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:first Townsend}.

< Higher cut efficiency indicates that we are capable of preserving more \eep s.

Even though this estimate is only an approximation, the overall cut efficiencies are not wildly off.
