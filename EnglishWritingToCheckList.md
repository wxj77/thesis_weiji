Now, priority of my thesis writing is clarity, deliever my idea with no confusion. But I should use at least 30 minutes every day to check grammar on my thesis. (Wei)

Spell checking.

Basic grammar checking. 
* Countable/not countable (c/nc), artilcle?
	* Add "the" where it is necessary.
	* Singular/plural of nouns.  
* singular/plural consitancy between subject and verb, especially after an "and", make sure the word form is consistant.
* The tense should be consistant in a sentence.
* Use transition words to make sure the connection between sentences.
* ... that ...: "that" better to serve as either a subject or an object. However, there is noun + that clause case.
* To describe a process in time sequence, use "First, Second, Then, Finally" to address the order.
* Be careful about the use of "This" to refer to previous situation, try using "This situation", "this process", "this effect", "this "noun"" instead.
* Be careful about the use of "It", instead using "This/That/The "noun"". 
* If possible, combine short sentenses, break long sentenses. 
* . That is -> ; that is
* . They are -> ; they are
* This, in turn, (not in return, two commas)
* different + plural 
* one of + plural
* keep "to +verb" together, and be flexible.
* with regard to (some aspect)
* compound words
	* if associated with timescale, always use "-", e.g. 1-day exposure.
	* if describing a noun with several adjectives, try using "-""  
* put two sentences together: 
	* whereas: Need to make two sentences or put "whereas" before "the choice" 
	* when

Word:
* "separately" - "according to", only keep one. 
* satisfyingly parsimonious..this isnot like something I am able to write
* disuss ~~about~~ /talk about...
* for LZ -> in LZ
* for the detector -> in the detector
* for this detector -> in this detector
* in range -> in the range of
* look for -> detect/uncover
* a study is done to do(not for doing).
* a study is done -> a study is undertaken/conducted/carried out
* "via"/"by meaning of"/"by using the method of" a technique
* spacial ->spatial
* information is plural, no "s"
* "the ratio of A to B", not ~~"the ratio between A and B"~~. (A/B)
* "compared to", not ~~"comparing to"~~

detail notes:

* rules that so far I summarize that make sense to me to add "the":
	* special noun, no "the", e.g. Wei, English. 
	* if I can use "a/an" to describe a noun (countable), use "a" or "the" in front of this noun. if the noun is not pre-defined, use "a/an", otherwise, use "the".  
	* "the" in front of plurals: if pre-defined, yes, use "the", if the plural refers to more general items, do not use "the". 
	* always use "the counts of"?
	* if the noun is a process: aka emission, breathe, do not use "the". (I guess it is not countable?)
* "that" in a sentense:
	* I believe this is correct (need to check with English native speaker):
		* This is a process in which a xenon atom emits photons. (correct)
		* This is a process that a xenon atom emits photons. (also correct but bad?)
* "It" refers to (1) the recent preceding noun. (2) The whole world (it is suggested that) 
* indicating (that) "useful to have that in the sentence."

Question:
* In "A between B and C, which ...", is "which" A or C? A.
* In "A in B, which", is "which" A or B? A. 
* Since efficiency is c/nc, which form should use? (efficiency, quantity, ) always singular except for these efficiencies, these quantities. need to check. 
* always use "the counts of"? shall i use "is" or "are" if using "the counts of" as an subject?	
* is "data" plural or singular? plural

* post pre need a hyphen?
* "which" and ",which"
* Figure illustration format/punctuation?: e.g.
	* Figure 1.1: Gas test layout: (a) detector, and sensors, (b) gas panel, (c) pump
	* Figure 1.16: Gas Test signal: anode cone event (cont.). (d) an example waveform (zoom in the range of 0 μs to 0.5 μs), (e) an example waveform (zoom in the range of 15 μs to 21 μs).
* I have a sentense. "A is B, indicating C". Is the subject of indicating "A is B"? 
* in vacuum/at vacuum/under vacuum.
* no "the" if describe a process? e.g. emission, breathing
* a type of "event" or "events"
* no +plural or sigular?
* what is the difference between of A and in A. 
* what is the difference between form/format/formation. The form of dark matter is dark matter particle. use class of candidate dark matter particles.
* zoomed view what is the term
* can I use vs., avg., cont., max., min., without explanation of the abbreviation?
* what is the verb for the process of relaxation (deexcite) of xenon atom?
* is this correct in grammar?
> Figure 1.22: Gas Test signal: electronic noise. (a) illustration cartoon. (b) an example waveform. Data were taken at 2017-12-8 14:02, with operation voltages VT and VB at +6kV and −6kV, operation detector gas density at 0.137 mol L−1.

* formatting question - after displayed equations, if the text that follows is part of the same paragraph, use a "\noindent " command to prevent a new paragraph from starting (or I think don't leave blank lines in latex) 
	> delete the empty space by just not leaving a empty line after \end{equation} or \end{align}. (Wei) 
 
*  The equation of a line is 

	   y=mx+b 

	 where y is the abscissa; x is the ordinate; m is the slope; and b is the y intercept. 
	 
* For multi-panel figures with long captions you can give individual or multiple sentences for each panel:

 "Figure 4.5: These plots show the single photo electron fits. (a) These are the fits for the first PMT. (b) These are the fits for the second PMT. (c)..."

adjectives: when you use "SPHE" and "like" together as an adjective to modify "signal", you can combine them with a hyphen to make a compound adjective as in "SPHE-like signal". This makes the role of each word more clear. An example for comparison: "the circle is 3 meters in diameter" has no hyphens, but turn it around to "a 3-meter-diameter circle" and notice that is easier to read than a "3 meter diameter circle". With the hyphens, your eye quickly separates the adjective(s) from the noun.
