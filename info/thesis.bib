abstract = {A theoretica study is made of damage effects by particle radiations in mater, and their dependence on energy, mass,, and charge number of an incoming particle, as well as on the composition of the medium. Typical examples of damage effects are the number of ion pairs formed in a gas, or the number of vacancies created in a crystal. The study is petition between energy transfer to atomic electrons and to translatory motion on of an atoms as a whole. For these purposes, common integril equations are formulated and studied. The study treats primarily average effects resulting from an atomic particle with given energy, but also their average fluctuation and probability distribution. As an important example, the division of the total energy dissipation, E, into energy given to recoiling atoms, nu , and energy given to electrons, E- nu , is studied. Several radiation effects are accounted for from knowledge about E and nu . The primary quantities in a study of radiation effects are the cross sections for all relevant collision processes. of cross sections are used, desimple approximations are introduced; analytical and numerical estimates are made of solutions to the integral equations. For many purposes, nuclear collisions and electronic collisions may be treated as if they were unconnected events, although this is not quite correct, especially at low energies. Considerable simplification is obtained by a suitable scaling of energy. A key to a common experimental and theoretical study is provided by an incoming particle identical with the atoms of the substance. Only few experiments can at present be compared quantitatively with theory.},

abstract = {We present a measurement of the extraction efficiency of quasi-free electrons from the liquid into the gas phase in a two-phase xenon time-projection chamber. The measurements span a range of electric fields from 2.4 to 7.1 kV/cm in the liquid xenon, corresponding to 4.5 to 13.1 kV/cm in the gaseous xenon. Extraction efficiency continues to increase at the highest extraction fields, implying that additional charge signal may be attained in two-phase xenon detectors through careful high-voltage engineering of the gate-anode region.},

@article{Cerenkov1937,
abstract = {In a note published in 1934 as well as in the subsequent publications the present author reported his discovery of feeble visible radiation emitted by pure liquids under the action of fast electrons ($\beta$-particles of radioactive elements or Compton electrons liberated in liquids in the process of scattering of $\gamma$-rays). This radiation was a novel phenomenon, which could not be identified with any of the kinds of luminescence then known, as the theory of luminescence failed to account for a number of unusual properties (insensitiveness to the action of quenching agents, anomalous polarization, marked spacial asymmetry, etc.) exhibited by the radiation in question. In 1934 the earliest results obtained in the experiments with $\gamma$-rays led S. I. Vavilov to interpret the radiation observed as a result of the retardation of the Compton electrons liberated in liquids by $\gamma$-rays. A comprehensive quantitative theory subsequently advanced by I. M. Frank and I. E. Tamm afforded an exhaustive interpretation of all the peculiarities of the new phenomenon, including its most remarkable characteristic - the asymmetry. According to their theory, an electron moving in a medium- of refractive index n with a velocity exceeding that of light in the same medium ($\beta$ {\textgreater} 1/n) is liable to emit light which must be propagated in a direction forming an angle $\theta$ with the path of the electron, this angle being determined by the equation: cos $\theta$ = 1/$\beta$ n (1) where $\beta$ is the ratio of the electron velocity to that of light in vacuum. A successful experimental verification of formula (1) was only performed with water for which, at the moment of publication of the above theory, data were already available which had been obtained by visual observations by the method of quenching. We recently performed additional experiments in which the intensity of radiation was recorded photographically, the records being taken simultaneously for all the angles $\theta$ lying in a plane passing through the primary electron beam. All the results obtained are in good agreement with I. M. Frank and I. E. Tamm's theory of the coherent radiation of electrons moving in a medium.

abstract = {The WIMP limit set by the Xenon10 experiment in 2007 signals a new$\backslash$nera in direct detection of dark matter, with several large-scale$\backslash$nliquid target detectors now under construction. A major challenge$\backslash$nin these detectors will be to understand backgrounds at the level$\backslash$nnecessary to claim a positive WIMP signal. In liquid xenon, these$\backslash$nbackgrounds are dominated by electron recoils, which may be distinguished$\backslash$nfrom the WIMP signal (nuclear recoils) by their higher charge-to-light$\backslash$nratio. During the construction and operation of Xenon10, the prototype$\backslash$ndetector Xed probed the physics of this discrimination. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nParticle interactions in liquid xenon both ionize and excite xenon$\backslash$natoms, giving charge and scintillation signals, respectively. Some$\backslash$nfraction of ions recombine, reducing the charge signal and creating$\backslash$nadditional scintillation. The charge-to-light ratio, determined by$\backslash$nthe initial exciton-ion ratio and the ion recombination fraction,$\backslash$nprovides the basis for discrimination between electron and nuclear$\backslash$nrecoils. Intrinsic fluctuations in the recombination fraction limit$\backslash$ndiscrimination. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nChanges in recombination induce an exact anti-correlation between$\backslash$ncharge and light, and when calibrated this anti-correlation distinguishes$\backslash$nrecombination fluctuations from uncorrelated fluctuations in the$\backslash$nmeasured signals. We determine the mean recombination and recombination$\backslash$nfluctuations as a function of energy and applied field for electron$\backslash$nand nuclear recoils, finding that recombination fluctuations are$\backslash$nalready the limiting factor for discrimination above {\~{}}12 keVr (nuclear$\backslash$nrecoil energy). Below 12 keVr statistical fluctuations in the number$\backslash$nof scintillation photons counted dominate, and we project a x6 improvement$\backslash$nin background rejection with a x2 increase in light collection efficiency.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nWe also build a simple recombination model that successfully reproduces$\backslash$nthe mean recombination in electron and nuclear recoils, including$\backslash$nthe the surprising reversal of the expected trend for recombination$\backslash$nwith ionization density in low energy electron recoils. The model$\backslash$nalso reproduces the measured recombination fluctuations to within$\backslash$na factor of two at high energies. Surprisingly, the model suggests$\backslash$nthat recombination at low energies is independent of ionization density,$\backslash$nand our observed discrimination is due not to the different stopping$\backslash$npowers of electrons and nuclei as was thought, but rather to a different$\backslash$ninitial exciton-ion ratio. We suggest two possible physical models$\backslash$nfor this new result.},

The decays of these isotopes at concentrations typical of research-grade xenon would be a dominant background for a WIMP search experiment. To remove these impurities from the liquid xenon, a chromatographic separation system based on adsorption on activated charcoal was built. 400 kg of xenon was processed, reducing the average concentration of krypton from 130 ppb to 3.5 ppt as measured by a cold-trap assisted mass spectroscopy system. A 50 kg batch spiked to 0.001 g/g of krypton was processed twice and reduced to an upper limit of 0.2 ppt.},

abstract = {(Abridged) New full sky temperature and polarization maps based on seven years of data from WMAP are presented. The new results are consistent with previous results, but have improved due to reduced noise from the additional integration time, improved knowledge of the instrument performance, and improved data analysis procedures. The improvements are described in detail. The seven year data set is well fit by a minimal six-parameter flat Lambda-CDM model. The parameters for this model, using the WMAP data in conjunction with baryon acoustic oscillation data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and priors on H{\_}0 from Hubble Space Telescope observations, are: Omega{\_}bh{\^{}}2 = 0.02260 +-0.00053, Omega{\_}ch{\^{}}2 = 0.1123 +-0.0035, Omega{\_}Lambda = 0.728 +0.015 -0.016, n{\_}s = 0.963 +-0.012, tau = 0.087 +-0.014 and sigma{\_}8 = 0.809 +-0.024 (68 {\%} CL uncertainties). The temperature power spectrum signal-to-noise ratio per multipole is greater that unity for multipoles {\textless} 919, allowing a robust measurement of the third acoustic peak. This measurement results in improved constraints on the matter density, Omega{\_}mh{\^{}}2 = 0.1334 +0.0056 -0.0055, and the epoch of matter- radiation equality, z{\_}eq = 3196 +134 -133, using WMAP data alone. The new WMAP data, when combined with smaller angular scale microwave background anisotropy data, results in a 3 sigma detection of the abundance of primordial Helium, Y{\_}He = 0.326 +-0.075.The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is now determined to be n{\_}s = 0.963 +-0.012, excluding the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles spectrum by {\textgreater}3 sigma. These new WMAP measurements provide important tests of Big Bang cosmology.},

abstract = {Together, the standard theory of big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the primeval deuterium abundance now very precisely peg the baryon density. Based upon our analysis of the deuterium data and the theoretical uncertainties associated with the BBN predictions, we determine Omega{\_}B h{\^{}}2 = 0.020$\backslash$pm 0.002 (95{\%} C.L.), with the uncertainty from the measured deuterium abundance about twice that from the predicted abundance. We discuss critically the reliability of the BBN baryon density, and in light of possible systematic uncertainties also derive a very conservative range. We conclude that within the standard cosmology and standard theory of BBN a baryon density Omega{\_}B h{\^{}}2=0.032 (the central value implied by recent CMB anisotropy measurements) simply cannot be accommodated.},

abstract = {We extend and explore the general non-relativistic effective theory of dark matter (DM) direct detection. We describe the basic non-relativistic building blocks of operators and discuss their symmetry properties, writing down all Galilean-invariant operators up to quadratic order in momentum transfer arising from exchange of particles of spin 1 or less. Any DM particle theory can be translated into the coefficients of an effective operator and any effective operator can be simply related to most general description of the nuclear response. We find several operators which lead to novel nuclear responses. These responses differ significantly from the standard minimal WIMP cases in their relative coupling strengths to various elements, changing how the results from different experiments should be compared against each other. Response functions are evaluated for common DM targets - F, Na, Ge, I, and Xe - using standard shell model techniques. We point out that each of the nuclear responses is familiar from past studies of semi-leptonic electroweak interactions, and thus potentially testable in weak interaction studies. We provide tables of the full set of required matrix elements at finite momentum transfer for a range of common elements, making a careful and fully model-independent analysis possible. Finally, we discuss embedding non-relativistic effective theory operators into UV models of dark matter.},

abstract = {Noble liquid radiation detectors have long been afflicted by spurious electron emission from their cathodic electrodes. This phenomenon must be understood and mitigated in the next generation of liquid xenon (LXe) experiments searching for WIMP dark matter or neutrinoless double beta decay, and in the large liquid argon (LAr) detectors for the long-baseline neutrino programme. We present a systematic study of this spurious emission involving a series of slow voltage-ramping tests on fine metal wires immersed in a two-phase xenon time projection chamber with single electron sensitivity. Emission currents as low as {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}-18{\}}{\$} A can thus be detected by electron counting, a vast improvement over previous dedicated measurements. Emission episodes were recorded at surface fields as low as {\$}\backslashsim{\$}10 kV/cm in some wires and observed to have complex emission patterns, with average rates of 10-200 c/s and outbreaks as high as {\$}\backslashsim{\$}10{\$}{\^{}}6{\$} c/s. A fainter, less variable type of emission was also present in all untreated samples. There is evidence of a partial conditioning effect, with subsequent tests yielding on average fewer emitters occurring at different fields for the same wire. We find no evidence for an intrinsic threshold particular to the metal-LXe interface which might have limited previous experiments up to fields of at least 160 kV/cm. The general phenomenology is not consistent with enhanced field emission from microscopic filaments, but it appears instead to be related to the quality of the wire surface in terms of corrosion and the nature of its oxide layer. This study concludes that some surface treatments, in particular nitric acid cleaning for stainless steel wires, can bringing about at least order-of-magnitude improvements in overall electron emission rates, and this should help the next generation of detectors achieve the required electrostatic performance.},

abstract = {We use high-resolution N-body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of halo mass, of initial density fluctuation spectrum, and of the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fit over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation which reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results to previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, which allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes the physical mechanisms that encode the type and quantity of cosmological matter in the properties of large-scale structure, and reviews the application of such tests to current datasets. The key lengths of the horizon size at matter-radiation equality and at last scattering determine the total matter density and its ratio to the relativistic density; acoustic oscillations can diagnose whether the matter is collisionless, and small-scale structure or its absence can limit the mass of any dark-matter relic particle. The most stringent constraints come from combining data on present-day galaxy clustering with data on CMB anisotropies. Such an analysis breaks the degeneracies inherent in either dataset alone, and proves that the universe is very close to flat. The matter content is accurately consistent with pure Cold Dark Matter, with about 25{\%} of the critical density, and fluctuations that are scalar-only, adiabatic and scale-invariant. It is demonstrated that these conclusions cannot be evaded by adjusting either the equation of state of the vacuum, or the total relativistic density.},

abstract = {We present results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the CMB. These data are consistent with the six-parameter inflationary LCDM cosmology. From the Planck temperature and lensing data, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0= (67.8 +/- 0.9) km/s/Mpc, a matter density parameter Omega{\_}m = 0.308 +/- 0.012 and a scalar spectral index with n{\_}s = 0.968 +/- 0.006. (We quote 68{\%} errors on measured parameters and 95{\%} limits on other parameters.) Combined with Planck temperature and lensing data, Planck LFI polarization measurements lead to a reionization optical depth of tau = 0.066 +/- 0.016. Combining Planck with other astrophysical data we find N{\_} eff = 3.15 +/- 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and the sum of neutrino masses is constrained to {\textless} 0.23 eV. Spatial curvature is found to be |Omega{\_}K| {\textless} 0.005. For LCDM we find a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r {\textless}0.11 consistent with the B-mode constraints from an analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP data leads to a tighter constraint of r {\textless} 0.09. We find no evidence for isocurvature perturbations or cosmic defects. The equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 +/- 0.045. Standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the Planck LCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We investigate annihilating dark matter and deviations from standard recombination, finding no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base LCDM are in agreement with BAO data and with the JLA SNe sample. However the amplitude of the fluctuations is found to be higher than inferred from rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. Apart from these tensions, the base LCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

A large area avalanche photodiode was used for the readout of the VUV secondary scintillation produced in the gas, together with the 5.9 keV x-rays directly absorbed in the photodiode. The latter was used as a reference for the determination of the number of charge carriers produced by the scintillation pulse and, thus, the number of VUV photons impinging the photodiode. A value of 140 photons/kV was obtained for the scintillation amplification parameter. The attained results are in good agreement with those predicted, for room temperature, by Monte Carlo simulation and Boltzmann calculations, as well as with those obtained for saturated xenon vapour, at cryogenic temperatures, and are about a factor of two higher than former results measured at room temperature. ? 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.},

abstract = {The relativistic band structure, deformation potentials, and effective masses for solid xenon are found by the orthogonalized plane wave method. This is supplemented by the tight-binding method, for comparison, and for the determination of certain valence band energies and effective masses. The problem of determining a suitable one-electron potential is discussed, and a new potential for insulators is developed, critically compared with other potentials, and used in the calculations. For comparison, results are also obtained with other potentials, and these are interpreted. Certain state-dependent and correlation effects for the entire band structure can be approximated, using known features of the potential for valence bands, and the resulting band structure is consistent with experiment. The effective mass at the conduction band minimum ($\Gamma$6+) is 0{\textperiodcentered}51 ± 0.04. Certain exciton states in the ultraviolet absorption spectrum are newly interpreted. Special aspects of rare gas solids are found to make deformation potential results somewhat uncertain: e.g. the change in the Xe band gap per unit dilation is predicted to be -1±2 eV. It is shown that the observed line widths of large-radius excitons in the absorption spectrum of Xe are much too large to arise from lifetime broadening due to weak coupling of Wannier excitons to phonons. {\textcopyright} 1967.},

@article{Navarro1996,
abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard Cold Dark Matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fit over two decades in radius by scaling a simple ``universal'' profile. The characteristic overdensity of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way which reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii, but are significantly shallower than {\$}r{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$} near the center and steeper than {\$}r{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$} near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies.},

abstract = {Results are presented from radioactivity screening of two models of photomultiplier tubes designed for use in current and future liquid xenon experiments. The Hamamatsu 5.6 cm diameter R8778 PMT, used in the LUX dark matter experiment, has yielded a positive detection of four common radioactive isotopes:238U,232Th,40K, and60Co. Screening of LUX materials has rendered backgrounds from other detector materials subdominant to the R8778 contribution. A prototype Hamamatsu 7.6 cm diameter R11410 MOD PMT has also been screened, with benchmark isotope counts measured at {\textless}0.4238U/{\textless}0.3232Th/{\textless}8.340K/2.0±0.260Co mBq/PMT. This represents a large reduction, equal to a change of ×124238U/×19232Th/×1840K per PMT, between R8778 and R11410 MOD, concurrent with a doubling of the photocathode surface area (4.5-6.4 cm diameter).60Co measurements are comparable between the PMTs, but can be significantly reduced in future R11410 MOD units through further material selection. Assuming PMT activity equal to the measured 90{\%} upper limits, Monte Carlo estimates indicate that replacement of R8778 PMTs with R11410 MOD PMTs will change LUX PMT electron recoil background contributions by a factor of ×125 after further material selection for60Co reduction, and nuclear recoil backgrounds by a factor of ×136. The strong reduction in backgrounds below the measured R8778 levels makes the R11410 MOD a very competitive technology for use in large-scale liquid xenon detectors. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

These results disfavor an explanation for the reported modulation in the 1.2-3.2 keVee energy range in CoGeNT in terms of nuclear recoils resulting from elastic scattering of WIMPs at {\textgreater}98{\%} confidence. For events consistent with electron recoils, no significant modulation is observed for either single- or multiple-detector interactions in the 3.0-7.4 keVee range.},

As with all noble element detectors, continuous purification of the detector medium is essential to produce a large ({\textgreater}1ms) electron lifetime; this is necessary for efficient measurement of the electron signal which in turn is essential for achieving robust discrimination of signal from background events. In this paper, we describe the development of a novel purification system deployed in a prototype detector. The results from the operation of this prototype indicated heat exchange with an efficiency above 94{\%} up to a flow rate of 42 slpm, allowing for an electron drift length greater than 1 m to be achieved in approximately 2 days and sustained for the duration of the testing period. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We present the results of the three-month above-ground commissioning run of the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment at the Sanford Underground Research Facility located in Lead, South Dakota, USA. LUX is a 370 kg liquid xenon detector that will search for cold dark matter in the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). The commissioning run, conducted with the detector immersed in a water tank, validated the integration of the various sub-systems in preparation for the underground deployment. Using the data collected, we report excellent light collection properties, achieving 8.4 photoelectrons per keV for 662 keV electron recoils without an applied electric field, measured in the center of the WIMP target. We also find good energy and position resolution in relatively high-energy interactions from a variety of internal and external sources. Finally, we have used the commissioning data to tune the optical properties of our simulation and report updated sensitivity projections for spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The LZ program consists of two stages of direct dark matter searches using liquid Xe detectors. The first stage will be a 1.5-3 tonne detector, while the last stage will be a 20 tonne detector. Both devices will benefit tremendously from research and development performed for the LUX experiment, a 350 kg liquid Xe dark matter detector currently operating at the Sanford Underground Laboratory. In particular, the technology used for cryogenics and electrical feedthroughs, circulation and purification, low-background materials and shielding techniques, electronics, calibrations, and automated control and recovery systems are all directly scalable from LUX to the LZ detectors. Extensive searches for potential background sources have been performed, with an emphasis on previously undiscovered background sources that may have a significant impact on tonne-scale detectors. The LZ detectors will probe spin-independent interaction cross sections as low as 5E-49 cm2 for 100 GeV WIMPs, which represents the ultimate limit for dark matter detection with liquid xenon technology.},

abstract = {Geant4 has been used throughout the nuclear and high-energy physics community to simulate energy depositions in various detectors and materials. These simulations have mostly been run with a source beam outside the detector. In the case of low-background physics, however, a primary concern is the effect on the detector from radioactivity inherent in the detector parts themselves. From this standpoint, there is no single source or beam, but rather a collection of sources with potentially complicated spatial extent. LUXSim is a simulation framework used by the LUX collaboration that takes a component-centric approach to event generation and recording. A new set of classes allows for multiple radioactive sources to be set within any number of components at run time, with the entire collection of sources handled within a single simulation run. Various levels of information can also be recorded from the individual components, with these record levels also being set at run time. This flexibility in both source generation and information recording is possible without the need to recompile, reducing the complexity of code management and the proliferation of versions. Within the code itself, casting geometry objects within this new set of classes rather than as the default Geant4 classes automatically extends this flexibility to every individual component. No additional work is required on the part of the developer, reducing development time and increasing confidence in the results. We describe the guiding principles behind LUXSim, detail some of its unique classes and methods, and give examples of usage. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {LUX is a two-phase (liquid/gas) xenon time projection chamber designed to detect nuclear recoils from interactions with dark matter particles. Signals from the LUX detector are processed by custom-built analog electronics which provide properly shaped signals for the trigger and data acquisition (DAQ) systems. The DAQ is composed of commercial digitizers with firmware customized for the LUX experiment. Data acquisition systems in rare-event searches must accommodate high rate and large dynamic range during precision calibrations involving radioactive sources, while also delivering low threshold for maximum sensitivity. The LUX DAQ meets these challenges using real-time baseline suppression that allows for a maximum event acquisition rate in excess of 1.5 kHz with virtually no deadtime. This paper describes the LUX DAQ and the novel acquisition techniques employed in the LUX experiment. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Large Underground Xenon (LUX) dark matter experiment aims to detect rare low-energy interactions from Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). The radiogenic backgrounds in the LUX detector have been measured and compared with Monte Carlo simulation. Measurements of LUX high-energy data have provided direct constraints on all background sources contributing to the background model. The expected background rate from the background model for the 85.3 day WIMP search run is (2.6±0.2stat±0.4sys) ×10-3events keVee-1kg-1day-1in a 118 kg fiducial volume. The observed background rate is (3.6±0.4stat)×10-3events keVee-1kg-1day-1, consistent with model projections. The expectation for the radiogenic background in a subsequent one-year run is presented. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are a leading candidate for dark matter and are expected to produce nuclear recoil (NR) events within liquid xenon time-projection chambers. We present a measurement of liquid xenon scintillation characteristics in the LUX dark matter detector and develop a pulse shaped based discrimination parameter to be used for particle identification. To accurately measure the scintillation characteristics, we develop a template-fitting method to reconstruct the detection time of photons. Analyzing calibration data collected during the 2013-16 LUX WIMP search, we measure a singlet-to-triplet scintillation ratio for electron recoils (ER) that is consistent with existing literature, and we make a first-ever measurement of the NR singlet-to-triplet ratio at recoil energies below 74 keV. A prompt fraction discrimination parameter exploits the difference of the photon time spectra for NR and ER events and is optimized to have the least number of ER events that occur in the 50$\backslash${\%} NR acceptance region. When this discriminator is used in conjunction with charge-to-light discrimination on the calibration data, the signal-to-noise ratio in the NR dark matter acceptance region increases by up to a factor of two.},

In this paper, the trigger efficiency, which is defined as the probability that an event of interest is selected for offline analysis, is studied using raw data obtained from both electron recoil (ER) and nuclear recoil (NR) calibrations. The measured efficiency exceeds 98$\backslash${\%} at a pulse area of 90 detected photons, which is well below the WIMP analysis threshold on the S2 pulse area. The efficiency also exceeds 98$\backslash${\%} at recoil energies of 1.3 keV and above, for both ER and NR.

More limited measurements were performed in C2H4 and SF6. Great care was taken to assure complete collection of electron and ion currents, and the absence of spurious instrumental errors. A new method was devised for obtaining absolute cross sections of gases relative to H2, and a McLeod gauge was used to obtain the absolute cross section in H2. The cross sections in NO and O2 could not be obtained by this method, and an approximate correction to direct McLeod‐gauge readings was used for these gases. It is believed that the results are as accurate as is possible with the present method. It is difficult to explain the differences found between cross sections measured by various investigators. McLeod‐gauge errors appear to account for most of the difference in absolute magnitude.},

Due to the long timescale, these signals can present a limiting background to the low-energy threshold of dark matter searches, and prevent discovery-class searches for MeV scale hidden sector dark matter. A systematic study reveals a fast (tau{\_}1) and slow (tau{\_}2) component to the background. The fast component is compatible with electrons which were trapped at the liquid surface, and can be reduced by increasing the electric field. However, the slow component increases linearly with electric field. Hypotheses for the origin of the effect are discussed, and techniques for mitigation are suggested.},

abstract = {LUX is a two-phase (liquid/gas) xenon time projection chamber designed to detect nuclear recoils resulting from interactions with dark matter particles. Signals from the detector are processed with an FPGA-based digital trigger system that analyzes the incoming data in real-time, with just a few microsecond latency. The system enables first pass selection of events of interest based on their pulse shape characteristics and 3D localization of the interactions. It has been shown to be {\textgreater}99{\%} efficient in triggering on S2 signals induced by only few extracted liquid electrons. It is continuously and reliably operating since its full underground deployment in early 2013. This document is an overview of the systems capabilities, its inner workings, and its performance.},

abstract = {The {\$}(x, y){\$} position reconstruction method used in the analysis of the complete exposure of the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment is presented. The algorithm is based on a statistical test that makes use of an iterative method to recover the photomultiplier tube (PMT) light response directly from the calibration data. The light response functions make use of a two dimensional functional form to account for the photons reflected on the inner walls of the detector. To increase the resolution for small pulses, a photon counting technique was employed to describe the response of the PMTs. The reconstruction was assessed with calibration data including {\$}{\{}{\}}{\^{}}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}83m{\}}{\}}{\$}Kr (releasing a total energy of 41.5 keV) and {\$}{\{}{\}}{\^{}}{\{}3{\}}{\$}H ({\$}\backslashbeta{\^{}}-{\$} with Q = 18.6 keV) decays, and a deuterium-deuterium (D-D) neutron beam (2.45 MeV). In the horizontal plane, the reconstruction has achieved an {\$}(x, y){\$} position uncertainty of {\$}\backslashsigma{\$}= 0.82 cm for events of only 200 electroluminescence photons and {\$}\backslashsigma{\$} = 0.17 cm for 4,000 electroluminescence photons. Such signals are associated with electron recoils of energies {\$}\backslashsim{\$}0.25 keV and {\$}\backslashsim{\$}10 keV, respectively. The reconstructed position of the smallest events with a single electron emitted from the liquid surface has a horizontal {\$}(x, y){\$} uncertainty of 2.13 cm.},

abstract = {The Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment operates at the Sanford Underground Research Facility to detect nuclear recoils from the hypothetical Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) on a liquid xenon target. Liquid xenon typically contains trace amounts of the noble radioactive isotopes85Kr and39Ar that are not removed by the in situ gas purification system. The decays of these isotopes at concentrations typical of research-grade xenon would be a dominant background for a WIMP search experiment. To remove these impurities from the liquid xenon, a chromatographic separation system based on adsorption on activated charcoal was built. 400 kg of xenon was processed, reducing the average concentration of krypton from 130 ppb to 3.5 ppt as measured by a cold-trap assisted mass spectroscopy system. A 50 kg batch spiked to 0.001 g/g of krypton was processed twice and reduced to an upper limit of 0.2 ppt.},

abstract = {Existing xenon dark matter (DM) direct detection experiments can probe the DM-nucleon interaction of DM with a sub-GeV mass through a search for photon emission from the recoiling xenon atom. We show that LUX's constraints on sub-GeV DM, which utilise the scintillation (S1) and ionisation (S2) signals, are approximately three orders of magnitude more stringent than previous xenon constraints in this mass range, derived from the XENON10 and XENON100 S2-only searches. The new LUX constraints provide the most stringent direct detection constraints for DM particles with a mass below 0.5 GeV. In addition, the photon emission signal in LUX and its successor LZ maintain the discrimination between background and signal events so that an unambiguous discovery of sub-GeV DM is possible. We show that LZ has the potential to reconstruct the DM mass with 20{\%} accuracy for particles lighter than 0.5 GeV.},

Liquid xenon charge and light yields for electronic recoil energies between 5.2 and 661.7 keV are measured, as well as the energy resolution for the LUX detector at those same energies. Additionally, there is an interpretation of existing measurements and descriptions of electron-ion recombination fluctuations in liquid xenon as limiting cases of a more general liquid xenon re- combination fluctuation model. Measurements of the standard deviation of these fluctuations at monoenergetic electronic recoil peaks exhibit a linear dependence on the number of ions for energy deposits up to 661.7 keV, consistent with previous LUX measurements between 2-16 keV with {\$}{\^{}}3{\$}H. We highlight similarities in liquid xenon recombination for electronic and nuclear recoils with a comparison of recombination fluctuations measured with low-energy calibration data.},

abstract = {We report constraints on spin-independent weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP)-nucleon scattering using a 3.35e4 kg-day exposure of the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment. A dual-phase xenon time projection chamber with 250 kg of active mass is operated at the Sanford Underground Research Facility under Lead, South Dakota (USA). With roughly fourfold improvement in sensitivity for high WIMP masses relative to our previous results, this search yields no evidence of WIMP nuclear recoils. At a WIMP mass of 50 GeV/c{\^{}}2, WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross sections above 2.2e-46 cm{\^{}}2 are excluded at the 90{\%} confidence level. When combined with the previously reported LUX exposure, this exclusion strengthens to 1.1e-46 cm{\^{}}2 at 50 GeV/c{\^{}}2.},

abstract = {LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) is a next generation dark matter direct detection experiment that will operate 4850 feet underground at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota, USA. Using a two-phase xenon detector with an active mass of 7 tonnes, LZ will search primarily for low-energy interactions with Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which are hypothesized to make up the dark matter in our galactic halo. In this paper, the projected WIMP sensitivity of LZ is presented based on the latest background estimates and simulations of the detector. For a 1000 live day run using a 5.6 tonne fiducial mass, LZ is projected to exclude at 90{\%} confidence level spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross sections above {\$}1.6 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-48{\}}{\$} cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$} for a 40 {\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}GeV{\}}/c{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$} mass WIMP. Additionally, a {\$}5\backslashsigma{\$} discovery potential is projected reaching cross sections below the existing and projected exclusion limits of similar experiments that are currently operating. For spin-dependent WIMP-neutron(-proton) scattering, a sensitivity of {\$}2.7 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-43{\}}{\$} cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$} ({\$}8.1 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-42{\}}{\$} cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$}) for a 40 {\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}GeV{\}}/c{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$} mass WIMP is expected. With construction well underway, LZ is on track for underground installation at SURF in 2019 and will start collecting data in 2020.},

abstract = {There is substantial evidence that over 80{\%} of matter in the universe is dark matter – which is non-baryonic in nature and is thought to be composed of a new, slow-moving, stable particle not found in the Standard Model of Particle Physics. Its presence is inferred from gravitational effects on luminous matter from several independent observations, from the galactic to the cosmological scale. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are the leading candidate, which can explain all of the observed effects. LUX and LZ are dual-phase xenon time projection chambers (TPC), aiming to observe scattering of WIMPs from xenon nuclei. LUX has an active mass of 250 kg of liquid xenon, and took data at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota, between 2013 and 2016. The first WIMP search run of 85 live days in 2013 set world-leading exclusion limits on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross section. This was improved by a reanalysis of those data, and subsequently by a new run yielding 332 live days, which set a minimum exclusion limit of 2.2 × 10−46 cm2 for a 50 GeV WIMP (90{\%} CL). In addition, the most stringent limit to date on the spin-dependent WIMP-neutron scattering cross section comes from the reanalysis of the 2013 dataset, with a minimum exclusion of 9.4 × 10−41 cm2 for a 33 GeV WIMP. LZ is a next generation experiment with a 7 tonne active mass to be deployed in the same location as LUX, expected to be 100 times more sensitive. Work presented in this thesis includes analysis of the 2013 LUX search data to produce the spin-dependent results, evaluating the detector response using a tritium $\beta$−source, and determining the 85Kr background from data. A study was carried out on spurious electron emission phenomena from thin cathodic wires under high electric fields, using LUX engineering data where the grid voltages were increased above nominal operating values; this led to new insights into the microscopic breakdown mechanisms which have affected these (and other) TPC detectors for decades. The detailed understanding of the electroluminescence response gained in LUX was applied to the design of the LZ electroluminescence region; detailed simulation work of electrode geometry was performed to assess the performance of several candidate designs.},

@article{Roberts2016,
abstract = {We revisit the WIMP-type dark matter scattering on electrons that results in atomic ionization, and can manifest itself in a variety of existing direct-detection experiments. Unlike the WIMP-nucleon scattering, where current experiments probe typical interaction strengths much smaller than the Fermi constant, the scattering on electrons requires a much stronger interaction to be detectable, which in turn requires new light force carriers. We account for such new forces explicitly, by introducing a mediator particle with scalar or vector couplings to dark matter and to electrons. We then perform state of the art numerical calculations of atomic ionization relevant to the existing experiments. Our goals are to consistently take into account the atomic physics aspect of the problem (e.g., the relativistic effects, which can be quite significant), and to scan the parameter space: the dark matter mass, the mediator mass, and the effective coupling strength, to see if there is any part of the parameter space that could potentially explain the DAMA modulation signal. While we find that the modulation fraction of all events with energy deposition above 2 keV in NaI can be quite significant, reaching {\~{}}50{\%}, the relevant parts of the parameter space are excluded by the XENON10 and XENON100 experiments.},

It was determined, that the different optical centers are responsible for the fluorescence and coloration of the irradiated PTFE. The fluorescent structures are formed both at a near-surface layer and in the bulk of the samples. Their concentration slightly changes at the various dosage of gamma-radiation (which ranged from 0.2 to 1.0 MGy), while it decreases notably with deepening into a sample. It was confirmed, that the molecular oxygen traces in a sample play a key role in the formation of the optical emission centers. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Fitzpatrick2013,
abstract = {We extend and explore the general non-relativistic effective theory of dark matter (DM) direct detection. We describe the basic non-relativistic building blocks of operators and discuss their symmetry properties, writing down all Galilean-invariant operators up to quadratic order in momentum transfer arising from exchange of particles of spin 1 or less. Any DM particle theory can be translated into the coefficients of an effective operator and any effective operator can be simply related to most general description of the nuclear response. We find several operators which lead to novel nuclear responses. These responses differ significantly from the standard minimal WIMP cases in their relative coupling strengths to various elements, changing how the results from different experiments should be compared against each other. Response functions are evaluated for common DM targets - F, Na, Ge, I, and Xe - using standard shell model techniques. We point out that each of the nuclear responses is familiar from past studies of semi-leptonic electroweak interactions, and thus potentially testable in weak interaction studies. We provide tables of the full set of required matrix elements at finite momentum transfer for a range of common elements, making a careful and fully model-independent analysis possible. Finally, we discuss embedding non-relativistic effective theory operators into UV models of dark matter.},

abstract = {This volume presents a thorough introduction to the theory and operation of drift chambers, one of the most important modern methods of elementary particle detection. The topics, presented in a text-book style with many illustrations, include the basics of gas ionization, by particles and by lasers, drift of electrons and ions in gases and signal creation and discuss in depth the fundamental limits of accuracy and the issue of particle identification. The book also surveys all types of drift chambers and the various drift-chamber gases in use. The calculation of the device parameters and physical processes are presented in some detail, as is all necessary background material. Thus the treatment, well beyond addressing the specialist in the field, is well suited to graduate physics students and nuclear engineers seeking a both thorough and pedagogical introduction to the field. The second edition presents a completely revised, updated and expanded version of this classic text. In particular, significantly more material on electronic signal creation, amplification and shaping has been added.},

This titanium has been measured with activities of {\$}{\^{}}{\{}238{\}}{\$}U{\$}{\_}{\{}e{\}}{\$}{\~{}}{\$}{\textless}{\$}1.6{\~{}}mBq/kg, {\$}{\^{}}{\{}238{\}}{\$}U{\$}{\_}{\{}l{\}}{\$}{\~{}}{\$}{\textless}{\$}0.09{\~{}}mBq/kg, {\$}{\^{}}{\{}232{\}}{\$}Th{\$}{\_}{\{}e{\}}{\$}{\~{}}{\$}=0.28\backslashpm 0.03{\$}{\~{}}mBq/kg, {\$}{\^{}}{\{}232{\}}{\$}Th{\$}{\_}{\{}l{\}}{\$}{\~{}}{\$}=0.25\backslashpm 0.02{\$}{\~{}}mBq/kg, {\$}{\^{}}{\{}40{\}}{\$}K{\~{}}{\$}{\textless}{\$}0.54{\~{}}mBq/kg, and {\$}{\^{}}{\{}60{\}}{\$}Co{\~{}}{\$}{\textless}{\$}0.02{\~{}}mBq/kg (68$\backslash${\%} CL). Such low intrinsic activities, which are some of the lowest ever reported for titanium, enable its use for future dark matter and other rare event searches. Monte Carlo simulations have been performed to assess the expected background contribution from the LZ cryostat with this radioactivity. In 1,000 days of WIMP search exposure of a 5.6-tonne fiducial mass, the cryostat will contribute only a mean background of {\$}0.160\backslashpm0.001{\$}(stat){\$}\backslashpm0.030{\$}(sys) counts.},

abstract = {A wealth of astronomical data indicate the presence of mass discrepancies in the Universe. The motions observed in a variety of classes of extragalactic systems exceed what can be explained by the mass visible in stars and gas. Either (i) there is a vast amount of unseen mass in some novel form - dark matter - or (ii) the data indicate a breakdown of our understanding of dynamics on the relevant scales, or (iii) both. Here, we first review a few outstanding challenges for the dark matter interpretation of mass discrepancies in galaxies, purely based on observations and independently of any alternative theoretical framework. We then show that many of these puzzling observations are predicted by one single relation - Milgrom's law - involving an acceleration constant (or a characteristic surface density) of the order of the square-root of the cosmological constant in natural units. This relation can at present most easily be interpreted as the effect of a single universal force law resulting from a modification of Newtonian dynamics (MOND) on galactic scales. We exhaustively review the current observational successes and problems of this alternative paradigm at all astrophysical scales, and summarize the various theoretical attempts (TeVeS, GEA, BIMOND, and others) made to effectively embed this modification of Newtonian dynamics within a relativistic theory of gravity.},

abstract = {The LZ experiment, featuring a 7-tonne active liquid xenon target, is aimed at achieving unprecedented sensitivity to WIMPs with the background expected to be dominated by astrophysical neutrinos. To reach this goal, extensive simulations are carried out to accurately calculate the electron recoil and nuclear recoil rates in the detector. Both internal (from target material) and external (from detector components and surrounding environment) backgrounds are considered. A very efficient suppression of background rate is achieved with an outer liquid scintillator veto, liquid xenon skin and fiducialisation. Based on the current measurements of radioactivity of different materials, it is shown that LZ can achieve the reduction of a total background for a WIMP search down to about 2 events in 1000 live days for 5.6 tonne fiducial mass.},

We have studied the effect of plasma-source ion implantation on the field emission behavior of large area stainless steel electrodes. Our apparatus allows operation of disc-shaped electrode pairs with 100 cm2 uniform field area to 125 kV. The cathode electrode is biased at high voltage, and the anode is electrically isolated, allowing measurement of the field emission current. during multi-hour runs at 30 MV/m. These Electrodes were either mechanically polished, or implanted with nitrogen ions. Two separate ion implanted electrodes have shown negligible field emission at 20 MV/m, and emission between 0.5 and 1.8 pA/cm2 electrodes show very little conditioning effect.},
