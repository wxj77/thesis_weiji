A little more clunky but more precise: 
The overall quantum efficiency of a PMT includes (1) the PMT photocathode quantum efficiency, (2) the PMT electron collection efficiency, and (3) the PMT electron gain.

The PMT photocathode QE is the probability per incident photon to produce a photoelectron. For 175 nm xenon scintillation light, there is a ~20% probability for 2 photoelectrons to be produced rather one, so called the double photoelectron effect. We use the term photons detected (PHD) to refer to the number of photons that produced >0 photoelectrons. The term PHE refers to the number of photoelectrons produced at the photocathode. The quantum efficiency for the top and bottom PMTs, as quoted by Hamamatsu, are 36.3% and 36.0%, respectively, for 175 nm light. The Hamamatsu QE does not account for the double photoelectron effect; that is, it is the average number of photoelectrons produced per incident photon, different from the average number of photons that produce a measurable signal per incident photon. (AF v2)

change PMT response to total Q.E of the PMT
(1) Photocathode Q.E.
(3) may not need to include (debatable) (AF)

Photocathode Q.E. Part: mention photocathode in the first sentence. PHD is normalizing out the double photoelectron effect. (AF)

A variety of process can give rise to signals in the detector. (TS)

PHD (PHOTONS detected)

the Average number of photoelectron produced assuming greater than zero photoelectron produced

questions to Alden Fan:

* have you read my thesis.
* How to minimize the cost of cpu in mac, aka which process is not necessary?
* good text editor for md.
* good resource for scintillation recombination ratio for xenon other than nest.
	* Phelps, g4ds(darkside), nest (Leonard 2015)
* Why recombination is REcombination, when is the first time it combines.

* before and after in slide 5
	* before: operat
	* after: change operation voltage so that PMT gain is the same.  
* what is the sharp cut off on x= 650 ns on slide 10, 11
* How do you compute duration?
* what is the se rate?  them are from wire? slide 16? No
* PTFE timing
* S1, S2 , why look like that?
